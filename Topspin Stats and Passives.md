Kizuna/Extremely Extreme fatigue: 

After an ally has taken 10% of their hp in one attack or reduced to 25% of total hp gain 2 defense power up each turn for the rest of the combat. 

Starts combat with 90% less HP/SP. Cannot restore HP/SP higher than 150. (stats take this into account)

defense power up does not stack from the same ally, remains at 2*y+x (y being DIFFERENT allies, x being defense power up from other sources) each turn
