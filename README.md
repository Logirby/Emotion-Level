# Emotion-fueled passive

Every clash results in an emotion coin, positive results for the user cause positive coins and negative results cause negative coins.

Once enough coins have been collected the Emotion Level will increase (0-5) and all Light will be restored.

Once Emotion Levels Up, it will be determined to be a Negative Emotion Level or a Positive Emotion Level from whatever coin type held majority (ties are solved by a coinflip, heads = positive tails = negative)

Positive Emotion Levels allow for a choice between 3 benefits: 

Positive Choice 1: Increase in Maximum Light (+1)

Positive Choice 2: Increase in Dice Power (+1)
